Dataset description:
-----------------------------
The data is provided in csv format, with ';' as separator and '\r\n' as newline 
character (Windows notation). For processing reasons, larger database extracts are 
summarized to 400 000 observations each with a single header line. All records have been
sorted by age, starting with the oldest.
If there are any questions about the handling or interpretation of the data, please send
them to pep725@geosphere.at.
Below the individual columns in detail, additional information is also available on our
homepage (https://pep725.eu)
 
column        description
s_id          Unique station identifyer, mean location of all plants observed at one point
provider_id   Unique ID of the collecting Phenological Network, see table above
lon			 geogr. longitude of the station (WGS84)
lat           geogr. latitude of the station (WGS84)
alt           Altitude of the station if reported from the network (-9999 missing value indicator)
alt_dem       As we do not have altitude information for all station we provide, as additional
              information, the sea level derived from digital elevation models (DEM) for the 
              given coordinates. Main source is the Aster Global Digital Elevation Model V1 2009
              (ASTER GDEM is a product of METI and NASA) accessed through the geonames.org webservice.
              For high latitudes USGS GTOPO30 was used as second source. Please note: high differences
              between alt and alt_dem MIGHT indicate problems in the station description - but in 
              mountains or on the coast little inaccuracies of the coordinates could lead to huge 
              deviations of the DEM altitude. We try to identify and correct those stations but that's
              a very time consuming task and not always possible. For now we recommend to handle stations
              with a difference between alt and alt_dem greater 50m (~ 3 * Mean Absolute Deviation)
              with appropriate care
gss_id        Unique plant identifyer, see also https://pep725.eu/pep725-plants/
genus         Plant genus
species       Plant species (if avalilable)
subspecies    Plant subspecies or cultivar (if available)
phase_id      Plant growing phase, from 0-99 it corresponds to the BBCH scale, above there are additional stages.
              The complete list you can find below and at https://pep725.eu/pep725-phases/ 
year          Year of observation
day           Day of Year (DOY), 1..First January, ...
date	       Date of observation, same as Year/Day for your convenience
cult_season   Season of cultivation: 0..not applicable, 1..summer cereals - sowing in spring, 2..winter cereals - sowing in autumn

Definition of growing stages:
-----------------------------
Below the list of already defined phenological phases of PEP725.
Please note that some phases were only provided for future expansion of the programme.
phase_id's up to 99 correspond to the well known BBCH-scale. From 100 upwards you will find additional phases which are not covered in the BBCH system.
